// to os.* on the qui host) and Noop (returns ErrNoFilesystemAccess for
// instances without filesystem access). A Remote implementation (SSH-backed)
// is planned. Services still call os.* directly; they adopt this interface
// in a separate callsite migration, after which the transport is transparent
