// RequestID is a middleware that injects a request ID into the context of each
// request. A request ID is a string of the form "host.example.com/random-0001",
// where "random" is a base62 random string that uniquely identifies this go
// process, and where the last number is an atomically incremented request
// counter.
var RequestID = middleware.RequestID

// Recoverer is a middleware that recovers from panics, logs the panic (and a
// backtrace), and returns a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status if
// possible. Recoverer prints a request ID if one is provided.
//
// Alternatively, look at https://github.com/go-chi/httplog middleware pkgs.
var Recoverer = middleware.Recoverer

// RealIP is a middleware that sets a http.Request's RemoteAddr to the results
// of parsing either the True-Client-IP, X-Real-IP or the X-Forwarded-For headers
// (in that order).
//
// This middleware should be inserted fairly early in the middleware stack to
// ensure that subsequent layers (e.g., request loggers) which examine the
// RemoteAddr will see the intended value.
//
// You should only use this middleware if you can trust the headers passed to
// you (in particular, the three headers this middleware uses), for example
// because you have placed a reverse proxy like HAProxy or nginx in front of
// chi. If your reverse proxies are configured to pass along arbitrary header
// values from the client, or if you use this middleware without a reverse
// proxy, malicious clients will be able to make you very sad (or, depending on
// how you're using RemoteAddr, vulnerable to an attack of some sort).
var RealIP = middleware.RealIP //nolint:staticcheck // SA1019: spoofable by design, which is why the auth-disabled CIDR allowlist runs before it in server.go; RemoteAddr past this point is for logs and throttling

// ThrottleBacklog is a middleware that limits number of currently processed
// requests at a time and provides a backlog for holding a finite number of
// pending requests.
var ThrottleBacklog = middleware.ThrottleBacklog
