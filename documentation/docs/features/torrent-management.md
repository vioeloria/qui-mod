# Torrent Management

qui provides tools to manage torrent lists: tags, categories, saved filter views, keyboard control, a torrent creator, `.torrent` export, MediaInfo, and BDInfo Disc reports. For queue, speed, and share limits, see [qBittorrent Preferences](./instance-settings.md#qbittorrent-preferences).

## Tags and categories

Manage tags and categories from the **Tags** and **Categories** sections in the filter sidebar. Click **Create tag** or **Create category** at the top of a section. Open the context menu on a tag or category for the other actions.

- **Create tag** adds one tag to the instance.
- **Delete Tag** removes a tag from the instance.
- **Delete unused tags** lists every tag with zero torrents and removes them in one step.
- **Create category** adds a category with an optional save path.
- **Create Subcategory** adds a child category. The dialog pre-fills the name with `parent/`.
- **Edit Category** changes the save path of a category. The name stays fixed.
- **Delete Category** removes one category.
- **Remove Empty Categories** lists every category with zero torrents and removes them in one step.

### Subcategories

qBittorrent stores a subcategory as a name with `/` separators, for example `media/movies`. qui shows the categories as a collapsible tree sorted by name when the instance supports subcategories (qBittorrent WebUI API 2.9.0 or newer). The qBittorrent preference **Enable Subcategories** (Instance Preferences > Files) must also be on. From WebUI API 2.15.0, subcategories are always on. In other cases, qui shows a flat list.

## Clear filters

Click **Clear filters** at the top of the filter sidebar to remove sidebar and column filters. The button appears when either group has active filters. Search text and sorting stay unchanged.

Open the arrow menu beside the button for these actions:

- **Clear sidebar filters** keeps column filters and search text.
- **Clear column filters** keeps sidebar filters and search text.
- **Clear filters and search** removes both filter groups and search text.

Each action keeps the current sort order. The table toolbar's clear button removes column filters only.

## Saved filter views

The **Views** section in the filter sidebar saves the current filter selection as a named view.

1. Select filters in the sidebar.
2. Click **Save current filters**.
3. Enter a name and click **Save**.

Click a saved view to apply its filters. qui highlights the active view. Each view has a menu with three actions:

- **Update filters** overwrites the view with the current sidebar selection. The confirmation toast has an **Undo** action that restores the previous filters.
- **Rename** changes the name of the view.
- **Delete** removes the view.

A view stores the sidebar filter selection only. It does not include search text, sorting, or column filters. Names must be unique and have a limit of 100 characters.

## Selection and keyboard control

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Click | Selects the row and opens the details panel. Click the same row again to close the panel and clear the selection. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + click | Toggles selection of the row |
| Shift + click | Selects the range from the last selected row |
| Ctrl/Cmd + A | Selects all torrents in the current view |
| Arrow Up / Arrow Down | Moves the selection one row |
| Enter | Opens the details panel for the focused row |
| Escape | Closes the details panel and clears the selection |

The arrow keys replace the selection with the focused row, the same as a plain click. When the details panel is open, it follows the arrow keys. If you type in an input field or open a dialog, hotkeys are inactive.

## Torrent creator

The **Create torrent** button opens the creator dialog. On desktop it is in the header. On phones it is the **Create** button in the bottom bar. It creates a new `.torrent` file from a file or folder on the qBittorrent server. The button appears only when the instance supports torrent creation, which requires qBittorrent 5.0 or newer (WebUI API 2.11.2).

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Source Path | Full path on the qBittorrent server. Suggestions appear as you type. | Required |
| Private torrent | Disables DHT, PEX, and local peer discovery | On |
| Trackers | Pick from active trackers or enter one URL per line | - |
| Comment | Free-text comment stored in the torrent | - |
| Source | Source field stored in the torrent | - |
| Add to qBittorrent | Adds the created torrent and starts seeding. When off, qui only creates the file for download. | On |
| Torrent Format | `v1 (Compatible)`, `v2 (Modern)`, or `Hybrid (v1 + v2)` | v1 |
| Piece Size | Piece size for the torrent | Auto |
| Save .torrent to (optional) | Full file path on the server for the created file. A directory alone is invalid. | - |
| Web Seeds (HTTP/HTTPS) | URLs where clients download content, one per line | - |

The last four fields are under **Advanced Options**.

:::note
Hybrid and v2 formats require a qBittorrent build with libtorrent 2. On a libtorrent 1.x build, qui creates v1 torrents only.

### Creation tasks

The **Torrent Creation Tasks** list in the header shows every creation job with its status: Queued, Running, Finished, or Failed. Running tasks show a progress bar. While tasks run, the list refreshes every 2 seconds. From a finished task, you can download the `.torrent` file or delete the task.

## Torrent export

**Export Torrent** in the torrent context menu downloads the `.torrent` file for the selected torrent. With multiple torrents selected, the action reads **Export Torrents (N)**. Export requires qBittorrent WebUI API 2.8.11 or newer.

Up to 10 torrents download as individual files. Larger selections download as one `qui-torrents.zip` archive. Inside the archive, qui groups files into folders by category. qui places torrents without a category into `Uncategorized`. When the selection spans multiple instances, each instance gets its own top-level folder.

If some torrents fail to export, the archive still downloads. An `export-errors.txt` file inside the archive lists the failures.

## Content tab sorting

The **Content** tab of the details panel shows the files of a torrent as a folder tree. Click a column header (**Name**, **Progress**, **Size**, or **Priority**) to sort the rows by that column. Click the same header again to reverse the direction. The narrow layout shows the same four choices as a row of buttons above the file list.

Folders always stay above files. A folder sorts by the total of its files. The **Priority** column appears only when the instance supports per-file priority. The sort resets to **Name** when you reload the page.

## MediaInfo

The **Content** tab of the details panel offers a **MediaInfo** action on each file. It analyzes the file on disk and opens a dialog with two tabs: **Summary** and **Raw JSON**. **Copy Summary** and **Copy JSON** copy the report to the clipboard.

Because qui reads the file from disk, MediaInfo requires the instance option **Local Filesystem Access**. See [Instance Settings](./instance-settings.md#local-filesystem-access).

## BDInfo

The **Content** tab offers a **BDInfo** action on each Disc in a torrent. A Disc is a folder that holds a `BDMV` folder, or an `.iso` file. A box set gets one action per Disc. DVD folders (`VIDEO_TS`) are not supported.

The first click starts a scan with [go-bdinfo](https://github.com/autobrr/go-bdinfo) and opens a dialog. The scan runs in the background, so you can close the dialog or leave the page. qui shows a toast when the scan finishes. Scans run one at a time in the order you start them. The dialog shows the queue position of a waiting scan, the progress of a running scan, and a **Cancel scan** button for both.

A finished scan opens a dialog with two tabs: **Quick Summary** and **Forum**. The Forum tab holds the BBCode block for tracker upload forms. Each tab has a copy button. The report covers the main playlist only.

qui keeps the report, so a second visit to the same Disc opens it at once. Two torrents on one instance that point at the same Disc share one report. **Rescan** replaces the stored report with a new scan. A scan that was running when qui restarted shows as failed; use **Rescan** to run it again.

Because qui reads the Disc from disk, BDInfo requires the instance option **Local Filesystem Access**. See [Instance Settings](./instance-settings.md#local-filesystem-access).
